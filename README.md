# monitor - Linux and AIX performance monitoring tool

The monitor is a command line tool to monitor system performance in an
at a glance view to show cpu, network, disk and process usage.

The tool was originally written in 1991 to support IBM RS/6000 AIX
monitoring and later ported to Linux in 2011. The latest version from
src-directory does not support the AIX anymore but has only Linux
support. The AIX specific codes are in the old directory.

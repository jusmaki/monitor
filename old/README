Monitor program is an AIX/6000 System performance monitor program.
Monitor-program can be used to display system statistics
of various short time performance values. Monitor program is available
from ftp.funet.fi using anonymous ftp from 
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/unix/AIX/RS6000/monitor-1.14.tar.Z -file.

New to version 1.14 (25-Mar-1996)
	* support for Symmetric multiprocessing cpuinfo (-smp option 
	  or 's' character command in interactive mode).
        * help page in interactive mode 'h' or '?' character commands

New to version 1.13-beta
	* support for plain ASCII output (-p option or output to a file with >)
	* support for AIX 4 (changes in get_ifnet)
	* changes in monitor-structures (get_topcpu.h memsize_4k->memsize_1k)
	* add '-r' option to display only runnable processes with -top
 	  eg. those processes which have used CPU time
        * fixed a bug in displaying more than 100 processes with -top

New to version 1.12 (16-Jun-1994)
	* show more detailed memory usage. (This is estimated
	  since there are no published AIX internals quide). Thanks
	  to Pierre Verpeaux for pointing this out from vmtune.c 
	  samples code.
	* rewrote part of the monitor code in a more layered method
	  (now interfaces to kernel are in libmonitor.a, see monitor.3)
        * fddi interface shown correctly
	* monitor -net to display more on network interface
	* disk information restructured to contain summary and detail
	* monitor -top with wide screen shows now more
	  information on processes
	* loadavgLED works now both on 3.2.4 and 3.2.5

New to version 1.11
        * support for more disk information with -disk flag
	* support for NFS operations display (eg. man nfsstat)

New to version 1.10
  	* fixed support for model 220 on memory displays (it should
          propably work, this has not been tested with many
          configurations). Made monitor to use avenrun values from
	  kernel which are supported after AIX 3.2.4.
	* a separate program is supplied for display loadaverage values in LEDs

Versions 1.07 - 1.09 were for internal testing 

New to version 1.06
	* support for IBM RISC System 6000 model 220. Monitor should now
	  displays amount of total memory correctly.
	* optional support for led display (compile loadavgd program
	  with -DLED option). (LED-display will show 1 minute load average
	  in RS/6000 front LED-display using letter 'c' and it's mirror image
	  as decimal point. Each time that loadavgd is responds to
	  getloadavg() call LED-display is refreshed and decimal point
	  is changed to its mirror image.)

New to version 1.06beta
	* support for AIX 3.2. Note, version compiled in AIX 3.2
	  don't work in AIX 3.1!
	* bug fixes
	* support for immediate screen refresh (with ctrl-L)
	* nroff -version of man-page in file monitor.1
	* for wider screens top will show user and system time distribution

New to version 1.04
	* process info sorted by cpu-usage (in top.c and top.h files)
	  try 'monitor -top'
	  Information shown are process-id, username, priority, nice-value,
	  program size (virtualmemeory), program size in real memory (RES),
	  process status, used cputime, cputime usage between display refresh.
	* new flags [-top [nprocs]] [-all]
	* changed exit with ctrl-c or q

New to version 1.03
	* included uptime-command that users loadavgd to get loadavgvalues

New to version 1.02
	* start using loadavgd-daemon
	* added ethernet-interface number to name
	
Values showed in monitor are (most of the values are converted
to units/second).
	* hostname and date
	* percentage distribution of cpu-load (system, wait, user and 
	  idle percentages) with graf where '=' means system,	
	  'W' means wait, ">" means user and "." means idle time.
	* runnable processes value/second and load average values
	  of 1, 5 and 15 minute times 
	* processes waiting to be swapped in
	* both free and total from real and virtual memory,
	  real memory is RAM-memory and virtual memory
	  is paging space
	* paging information; pagefaults, pages to be paged in and out
	  from user space and pages to be paged in and out from
	  paging (swap) space, page size in AIX 3.1 is 4 kB,
	* various process and system events: process (context) switches,
	  system call, read and write -calls, forks and execs,
	  three interrupts rcvint, xmtint, mdmint.
	* File and tty-IO variables; iget, namei and dirblk, amout of read
	  and written kbytes, amount of ttybased characters handled.
	* Disk-information, read and written bytes/second and amount
	  of busy time 
	* network (netw) information; amount read and written kB per second.
        * SMP Symmetric MultiProcessor information for SMP machines

	AIX commands vmstat(1), sar(1), netstat(1)
	/usr/include/sys/{sysinfo.h, vminfo.h, iostat.h}
	/usr/include/sys/if.h


How to install:
	To install the monitor place the source to appropriate
 	directory, then use 
		make 
	command to compile the sources.	Programs can be installed with
		make install command
	by default programs are installed to /usr/local/bin
	directory.

New plan:
	* v2.0 together with Marcel J.E. Mol  <marcel@mesa.nl>
          to support better file logging and cleaner code.
	  Actually most of code is done (25-Mar-96), I just should have
          a bit of time to add the SMP support to v2.0.
        * v2.1 to support RPC like network communication

Old plan:
	* X11-userinterface
	* performance recording and display of recorded values
	* multihost monitoring
